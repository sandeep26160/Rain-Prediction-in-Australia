# Rain-Prediction-in-Australia

In this notebook, you will  practice all the classification algorithms that we have learned in this course.


Below, is where we are going to use the classification algorithms to create a model based on our training data and evaluate our testing data using evaluation metrics learned in the course.

We will use some of the algorithms taught in the course, specifically:

1. Linear Regression
2. KNN
3. Decision Trees
4. Logistic Regression
5. SVM

We will evaluate our models using:

1.  Accuracy Score
2.  Jaccard Index
3.  F1-Score
4.  LogLoss
5.  Mean Absolute Error
6.  Mean Squared Error
7.  R2-Score

Finally, you will use your models to generate the report at the end.
